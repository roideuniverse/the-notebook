# the-notebook
Note taking Android App

There are 4 basic features in this app. UI design is flexible - feel free to change it.

1. User should be able to add a new entry.
   [Issue-#3](https://github.com/roideuniverse/the-notebook/issues/3)

2. The entry should get saved in the google drive backend.
   Like google docs or sheets if possible.
   (the idea behind saving it there is that - data can still be viewed without the app )
   [Issue-#8](https://github.com/roideuniverse/the-notebook/issues/8)

3. The user should get a reminder at the end of the day (configurable through settings page)
   to add an entry for the day.
   [Issue-#5](https://github.com/roideuniverse/the-notebook/issues/5)

4. The home/main screen of the app should show the entries in a timeline fashion.
